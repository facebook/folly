Folly: Facebook Open-source LibrarY
-----------------------------------

Folly is an open-source C++ library developed and used at Facebook.

For details, see folly/docs/Overview.md.

Folly is published on Github at https://github.com/facebook/folly; for
discussions, there is a Google group at
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/facebook-folly.


Dependencies
------------

folly requires gcc 4.8+ and a version of boost compiled with C++11 support.

Please download googletest from
https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip and unzip it in the
folly/test subdirectory.

Ubuntu 13.10
------------

The following packages are required (feel free to cut and paste the apt-get
command below):

sudo apt-get install \
    g++ \
    automake \
    autoconf \
    autoconf-archive \
    libtool \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libevent-dev \
    libdouble-conversion-dev \
    libgoogle-glog-dev \
    libgflags-dev \
    liblz4-dev \
    liblzma-dev \
    libsnappy-dev \
    make \
    zlib1g-dev \
    binutils-dev \
    libjemalloc-dev

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
----------------

The packages listed above for Ubuntu 13.10 are required, as well as:

sudo apt-get install \
    libiberty-dev

The above packages are sufficient for Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04.

In the folly directory, run
  autoreconf -ivf
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  sudo make install


Other Linux distributions
-------------------------

- double-conversion (http://code.google.com/p/double-conversion/)

    By default, the build tooling for double-conversion does not build
    any libraries, which folly requires.  To build the necessary libraries
    copy folly/SConstruct.double-conversion to your double-conversion
    source directory before building:

      [double-conversion/] scons -f SConstruct.double-conversion

    Then set CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS so that folly can find your double-conversion
    build:

      [folly/] LDFLAGS=-L<double-conversion>/ CPPFLAGS=-I<double-conversion>/src/
        configure ...
