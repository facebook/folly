/**
 * Tiny exclusive lock that uses 2 bits. It is stored as 1 byte and
 * has APIs for using the remaining 6 bits for storing user data.
 *
 * You should zero-initialize the bits of a MicroLock that you intend
 * to use.
 *
 * If you're not space-constrained, prefer std::mutex, which will
 * likely be faster, since it has more than two bits of information to
 * work with.
 *
 * You are free to put a MicroLock in a union with some other object.
 * If, for example, you want to use the bottom two bits of a pointer
 * as a lock, you can put a MicroLock in a union with the pointer,
 * which will use the two least-significant bits in the bottom byte.
 *
 * (Note that such a union is safe only because MicroLock is based on
 * a character type, and even under a strict interpretation of C++'s
 * aliasing rules, character types may alias anything.)
 *
 * Unused bits in the lock can be used to store user data via
 * lockAndLoad() and unlockAndStore(), or LockGuardWithData.
 *
 * MicroLock uses a dirty trick: it actually operates on the full
 * 32-bit, four-byte-aligned bit of memory into which it is embedded.
 * It never modifies bits outside the ones it's defined to modify, but
 * it _accesses_ all the bits in the 32-bit memory location for
 * purposes of futex management.
 *
 * The MaxSpins template parameter controls the number of times we
 * spin trying to acquire the lock.  MaxYields controls the number of
 * times we call sched_yield; once we've tried to acquire the lock
 * MaxSpins + MaxYields times, we sleep on the lock futex.
 * By adjusting these parameters, you can make MicroLock behave as
 * much or as little like a conventional spinlock as you'd like.
 *
 * Performance
 * -----------
 *
 * With the default template options, the timings for uncontended
 * acquire-then-release come out as follows on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
 * E5-2660 0 @ 2.20GHz, in @mode/opt, as of the master tree at Tue, 01
 * Mar 2016 19:48:15.
