    // The value *counter is sampled from an exponential distribution, so we can
    // use the memoryless property Pr(T > s + t | T > s) = Pr(T > t). In other
    // words, if we subtract any amount s from *counter and *counter is still
    // positive, then the expected wait time will be unchanged. If we resample
    // *counter from that exponential distribution, the expected wait time will
    // also be unchanged. What we are going to do is pick an amount to subtract
    // from the counter that is quick to calculate. Once we detect a possible
    // event using an over-approximation, we will perform a second calculation
    // to check if we would have likewise produced an event using the precise
    // step size.
    //
    // In order to facilitate a quick approximation, we will use
    //   X ~ Exp(2^k)
    // as our distribution. See kScaleBits for k.
    //
    // After every pass through this coinflip function, the value *counter is
    // still a valid sample from Exp(2^k), which means that for any value wait
    // passed into the function, we can produce a positive signal with the
    // correct probability. That means that if one code location calls
    // coinflip(1000) nine times, we can then use the same counter for a call
    // to coinflip(100) in an unrelated code location.
    //
    // Since value *counter was sampled from an Exp(2^k) distribution, it
    // represents the wait time until the next event. We can calculate the
    // precise wait time by using the CDF for an exponential distribution,
    //   CDF(step | scale=2^k) = 1 - e^(-step/(2^k)).
    // We set the CDF to the expected probability of 1/wait and solve for step:
    //   1/wait = 1 - e^(-step/(2^k))
    //   step = -ln(1 - 1/wait) * 2^k.
    //
    // However, this is expensive to calculate on the fast path, so instead we
    // find an approximation for the step size by using an approximation for
    // the ln function. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. We can imagine placing
    // a line tangent to the graph of ln(x) with a slope of 1/x, and using that
    // line for our approximation. In order to avoid divisions later on, we
    // will only use slopes where x is a power of 2. That gives us
    //   ln(x) ~= mx+b = (1/2^c)x + b
    // where c is some constant and b won't end up mattering.
    //
    // The value we are approximating is
    //   ln(1 - 1/wait) = ln((wait-1)/wait) = ln(wait-1) - ln(wait).
    //
    // Since we are approximating ln(x) using a line, the result is equal to the
    // inverse of the slope we are using for an estimate. That is,
    //   ln(wait-1) - ln(wait) ~= ((1/2^c)(wait-1) + b) - ((1/2^c)(wait) + b)
    //                          = -1/(2^c).
    //
    // This gives us
    //   step  = -ln(1 - 1/wait) * 2^k
    //   step ~= (2^k) / (2^c).
    //
    // As long as our step estimate is greater than the precise step, we will
    // generate false positives. If instead the step estimate were less than the
    // precise step, we would have false negatives, which we can't correct. To
    // make sure our step estimate is greater than the precise step, we need to
    // use the slope approximation for the value wait-1.
    //
    // That slope approximation is equal to the number of bits needed to encode
    // the value, or the floor(lg(x)) function (integer log base 2). We then
    // multiply by the scale of 2^k for the exponential distribution, which is
