  // WTCallback->Promise->Core->WTCallbak, so three of them won't go away until
  // we break the circular reference. The break happens either in
  // WTCallback::timeoutExpired or WTCallback::interruptHandler. Former means
  // timeout callback is being safely executed. Latter captures shared_ptr of
  // WTCallback again in another lambda for canceling timeout. The moment
  // canceling timeout is executed in EventBase thread, the actual timeout
  // callback has either been executed, or will never be executed. So we are
  // fine here.
