///
/// Ownership of the mutex is not tied to any particular thread.
/// This allows the coroutine owning the lock to transition from one thread
/// to another while holding the lock and then perform the unlock() operation
/// on another thread.
///
/// This mutex guarantees a FIFO scheduling algorithm - coroutines acquire the
/// lock in the order that they execute the 'co_await mutex.co_lock()'
/// operation.
///
/// Note that you cannot use std::scoped_lock/std::lock_guard to acquire the
/// lock as the lock must be acquired with use of 'co_await' which cannot be
/// used in a constructor.
///
/// You can still use the std::scoped_lock/std::lock_guard in conjunction with
/// std::adopt_lock to automatically unlock the mutex when the current scope
/// exits after having locked the mutex using either 'co_await m.co_lock()'
/// or 'm.try_lock()'.
///
/// You can also attempt to acquire the lock using std::unique_lock in
/// conjunction with std::try_to_lock.
///
/// For example:
///   folly::coro::Mutex m;
///   folly::Executor& executor;
///
///   folly::coro::Task<> asyncScopedLockExample()
///   {
///     std::unique_lock<folly::coro::Mutex> lock = co_await m.co_scoped_lock();
///     ...
///   }
///
///   folly::coro::Task<> asyncManualLockAndUnlock()
///   {
///     co_await m.co_lock(executor);
///     ...
///     m.unlock();
///   }
///
///   void nonAsyncTryLock()
///   {
///     if (m.try_lock())
///     {
///       // Once the lock is acquired you can pass ownership of the lock to
///       // a std::lock_guard object.
///       std::lock_guard<folly::coro::Mutex> lock{m, std::adopt_lock};
