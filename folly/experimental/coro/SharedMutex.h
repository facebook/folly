/// The folly::coro::SharedMutexFair class provides a thread synchronisation
/// primitive that allows a coroutine to asynchronously acquire a lock on the
/// mutex.
///
/// The mutex supports two kinds of locks:
/// - exclusive-lock - Also known as a write-lock.
///                    While an exclusive lock is held, no other thread will be
///                    able to acquire either an exclusive lock or a shared
///                    lock until the exclusive lock is released.
/// - shared-lock    - Also known as a read-lock.
///                    The mutex permits multiple shared locks to be held
///                    concurrently but does not permit shared locks to be held
///                    concurrently with exclusive locks.
///
/// This mutex employs a fair lock acquisition strategy that attempts to process
/// locks in a mostly FIFO order in which they arrive at the mutex.
/// This means that if the mutex is currently read-locked and some coroutine
/// tries to acquire a write-lock, that subsequent read-lock attempts will
/// be queued up behind the write-lock, allowing the write-lock to be acquired
/// in a bounded amount of time.
///
/// One implication of this strategy is that it is not safe to unconditionally
/// acquire a new read-lock while already holding a read-lock, since it's
/// possible that this could lead to deadlock if there was another coroutine
/// that was currently waiting on a write-lock.
///
/// The locks acquired by this mutex do not have thread affinity. A coroutine
/// can acquire the lock on one thread and release the lock on another thread.
///
/// Example usage:
///
///  class AsyncStringSet {
///    mutable folly::coro::SharedMutexFair mutex_;
///    std::unordered_set<std::string> values_;
///
///    AsyncStringSet() = default;
///
///    folly::coro::Task<bool> insert(std::string value) {
///      auto lock = co_await mutex_.co_scoped_lock();
///      co_return values_.insert(value).second;
///    }
///
///    folly::coro::Task<bool> remove(std::string value) {
///      auto lock = co_await mutex_.co_scoped_lock();
///      co_return values_.erase(value) > 0;
///    }
///
///    folly::coro::Task<bool> contains(std::string value) const {
///      auto lock = co_await mutex_.co_scoped_shared_lock();
///      co_return values_.count(value) > 0;
///    }
