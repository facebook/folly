 * LogHandler represents a generic API for processing log messages.
 *
 * LogHandlers have an associated log level.  The LogHandler will discard any
 * messages below its log level.  This allows specific LogHandlers to perform
 * additional filtering of messages even if the messages were enabled at the
 * LogCategory level.  For instance, a single LogCategory may have two
 * LogHandlers attached, one that logs locally to a file, and one that sends
 * messages to a remote logging service.  The local LogHandler may be
 * configured to record all messages, but the remote LogHandler may want to
 * only process ERROR messages and above, even when debug logging is enabled
 * for this LogCategory.
 *
 * By default the LogHandler level is set to LogLevel::NONE, which means that
 * all log messages will be processed.
