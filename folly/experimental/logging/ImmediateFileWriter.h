 * A LogWriter implementation that immediately writes to a file descriptor when

 * normal program threads, so that logging I/O may block or slow down normal
 * processing.
 *
 * However, one benefit of this class is that log messages are written out
 * immediately, so if your program crashes, all log messages generated before
 * the crash will have already been written, and no messages will be lost.
