/**
 * A space-efficient static data structure to store a non-decreasing sequence of
 * b-bit integers. If the integers are uniformly distributed lookup is O(1)-time
 * and performs a single random memory lookup with high probability.
 *
 * Space for n keys is bounded by (5 + b - log(n / loadFactor)) / loadFactor
 * bits per element, which makes it particularly efficient for very dense
 * sets. Note that 1 bit is taken up by the user-provided block payloads, and 1
 * depends on how close the table size is to a power of 2. Experimentally,
 * performance is good up to load factor 95%.
 *
 * Lookup returns a range of positions in the table. The intended use case is to
 * store hashes, as the first layer of a multi-layer hash table. If b is sized
 * to floor(log(n)) + k, the probability of a false positive (a non-empty range
 * is returned for a non-existent key) is approximately 2^-k, which makes it
 * competitive with a Bloom filter for low FP probabilities, with the additional
 * benefit that it also returns a range of positions to restrict the search in
 * subsequent layers.
 *
 * The data structure is inspired by the Rank-Select Quotient Filter
 * introduced in
 *
 *   Prashant Pandey, Michael A. Bender, Rob Johnson and Robert Patro,
 *   A General-Purpose Counting Filter: Making Every Bit Count, SIGMOD, 2017
 *
 * Besides being static, QuotientMultiSet differs from the data structure from
 * the paper in the following ways:
 *
 * - The table size can be arbitrary, rather than just powers-of-2. This can
 *   waste up to a bit for each residual, but it prevents 2x overhead when the
 *   desired table size is slightly larger than a power of 2.
 *
 * - Within each block all the holes are moved at the end. This enables
 *   efficient iteration, and makes the returned positions a contiguous range
 *   for each block, which allows to use them to index into a secondary data
 *   structure. An arbitrary 64-bit payload can be attached to each block; for
 *   example, this can be used to store the number of elements up to that block,
 *   so that positions can be translated to the element rank. Alternatively, the
 *   payload can be used to address blocks in the secondary data structure.
 *
 * - Correctness does not depend on the keys being uniformly distributed.
 *   However, performance does, as for arbitrary keys the worst-case lookup time
 *   can be linear.
 *
 * Implemented by Matt Ma based on a prototype by Giuseppe Ottaviano and
 * Sebastiano Vigna.
 *
 * Data layout:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Block | Block | Block | Block |  ...                         | Block |
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                /        |
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Payload | Occupieds | Offset | Runends |       Remainders * 64       |
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Each block contains 64 slots. Keys mapping to the same slot are stored
 * contiguously in a run. The occupieds and runends bitvectors are the
 * concatenation of the corresponding words in each block.
 *
 * - Occupieds bit indicates whether there is a key mapping to this quotient.
 *
 * - Offset stores the position of the runend of the first run in this block.
 *
 * - Runends bit indicates whether the slot is the end of some run. 1s in
 *   occupieds and runends bits are in 1-1 correspondence: the i-th 1 in the
 *   runends vector marks the run end of the i-th 1 in the occupieds.
