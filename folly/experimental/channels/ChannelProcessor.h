/**
 * This object allows for memory-efficient processing of values many channels.
 *
 * A channel is added with a unique key and a callback. The callback will be
 * called for every value pushed to the receiver.
 *
 * A resumable channel can also be added. A resumable channel involves two
 * callbacks. An initialization callback is called to get the receiver, and the
 * update callback is called on every update (as for a normal channel). The
 * update callback can throw a ReinitializeException at any time, which will
 * trigger the initialize callback to re-run.
 *
 * Values for a given channel are processed until one of the following occurs:
 *     1. The channel is closed
 *     2. The channel callback throws an OnClosedException
 *     3. The channel callback throws a folly::OperationCancelled exception.
 *     4. The channel is removed with a call to removeChannel.
 *
 * If a channel is removed with removeChannel, processing will eventually stop
 * for that channel. This will not necessarily happen immediately.
 *
 * If a channel is added for an already existing key, the previous channel for
 * that key will be removed and processing will eventually stop.
 *
 * Processing for all channels will run on the user-provided executor. For any
 * particular channel, all processing will happen sequentially. For any two
 * distinct channels, processing may happen in parallel (subject to any
 * constraints of the provided executor).
