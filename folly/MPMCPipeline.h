/**
 * Multi-Producer, Multi-Consumer pipeline.
 *
 * A N-stage pipeline is a combination of N+1 MPMC queues (see MPMCQueue.h).
 *
 * At each stage, you may dequeue the results from the previous stage (possibly
 * from multiple threads) and enqueue results to the next stage. Regardless of
 * the order of completion, data is delivered to the next stage in the original
 * order.  Each input is matched with a "ticket" which must be produced
 * when enqueueing to the next stage.
 *
 * A given stage must produce exactly K ("amplification factor", default K=1)
 * results for every input. This is enforced by requiring that each ticket
 * is used exactly K times.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * // arguments are queue sizes
 * MPMCPipeline<int, std::string, int> pipeline(10, 10, 10);
 *
 * pipeline.blockingWrite(42);
 *
 * {
 *   int val;
 *   auto ticket = pipeline.blockingReadStage<0>(val);
 *   pipeline.blockingWriteStage<0>(ticket, folly::to<std::string>(val));
 * }
 *
 * {
 *   std::string val;
 *   auto ticket = pipeline.blockingReadStage<1>(val);
 *   int ival = 0;
 *   try {
 *     ival = folly::to<int>(val);
 *   } catch (...) {
 *     // We must produce exactly 1 output even on exception!
 *   }
 *   pipeline.blockingWriteStage<1>(ticket, ival);
 * }
 *
 * int result;
 * pipeline.blockingRead(result);
 * // result == 42
 *
 * To specify amplification factors greater than 1, use
 * MPMCPipelineStage<T, amplification> instead of T in the declaration:
 *
 * MPMCPipeline<int,
 *              MPMCPipelineStage<std::string, 2>,
 *              MPMCPipelineStage<int, 4>>
 *
 * declares a two-stage pipeline: the first stage produces 2 strings
 * for each input int, the second stage produces 4 ints for each input string,
 * so, overall, the pipeline produces 2*4 = 8 ints for each input int.
 *
 * Implementation details: we use N+1 MPMCQueue objects; each intermediate
 * queue connects two adjacent stages.  The MPMCQueue implementation is abused;
 * instead of using it as a queue, we insert in the output queue at the
 * position determined by the input queue's popTicket_.  We guarantee that
 * all slots are filled (and therefore the queue doesn't freeze) because
 * we require that each step produces exactly K outputs for every input.
