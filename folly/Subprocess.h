/**
 * Subprocess library, modeled after Python's subprocess module
 * (http://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html)
 *
 * This library defines one class (Subprocess) which represents a child
 * process.  Subprocess has two constructors: one that takes a vector<string>
 * and executes the given executable without using the shell, and one
 * that takes a string and executes the given command using the shell.
 * Subprocess allows you to redirect the child's standard input, standard
 * output, and standard error to/from child descriptors in the parent,
 * or to create communication pipes between the child and the parent.
 *
 * The simplest example is a thread-safe [1] version of the system() library
 * function:
 *    Subprocess(cmd).wait();
 * which executes the command using the default shell and waits for it
 * to complete, returning the exit status.
 *
 * A thread-safe [1] version of popen() (type="r", to read from the child):
 *    Subprocess proc(cmd, Subprocess::Options().pipeStdout());
 *    // read from proc.stdoutFd()
 *    proc.wait();
 *
 * A thread-safe [1] version of popen() (type="w", to write to the child):
 *    Subprocess proc(cmd, Subprocess::Options().pipeStdin());
 *    // write to proc.stdinFd()
 *    proc.wait();
 *
 * If you want to redirect both stdin and stdout to pipes, you can, but note
 * that you're subject to a variety of deadlocks.  You'll want to use
 * nonblocking I/O, like the callback version of communicate().
 *
 * The string or IOBuf-based variants of communicate() are the simplest way
 * to communicate with a child via its standard input, standard output, and
 * standard error.  They buffer everything in memory, so they are not great
 * for large amounts of data (or long-running processes), but they are much
 * simpler than the callback version.
 *
 * == A note on thread-safety ==
 *
 * [1] "thread-safe" refers ONLY to the fact that Subprocess is very careful
 * to fork in a way that does not cause grief in multithreaded programs.
 *
 * Caveat: If your system does not have the atomic pipe2 system call, it is
 * not safe to concurrently call Subprocess from different threads.
 * Therefore, it is best to have a single thread be responsible for spawning
 * subprocesses.
 *
 * A particular instances of Subprocess is emphatically **not** thread-safe.
 * If you need to simultaneously communicate via the pipes, and interact
 * with the Subprocess state, your best bet is to:
 *  - takeOwnershipOfPipes() to separate the pipe I/O from the subprocess.
 *  - Only interact with the Subprocess from one thread at a time.
 *
 * The current implementation of communicate() cannot be safely interrupted.
 * To do so correctly, one would need to use EventFD, or open a dedicated
 * pipe to be messaged from a different thread -- in particular, kill() will
 * not do, since a descendant may keep the pipes open indefinitely.
 *
 * So, once you call communicate(), you must wait for it to return, and not
 * touch the pipes from other threads.  closeParentFd() is emphatically
 * unsafe to call concurrently, and even sendSignal() is not a good idea.
 * You can perhaps give the Subprocess's PID to a different thread before
 * starting communicate(), and use that PID to send a signal without
 * accessing the Subprocess object.  In that case, you will need a mutex
 * that ensures you don't wait() before you sent said signal.  In a
 * nutshell, don't do this.
 *
 * In fact, signals are inherently concurrency-unsafe on Unix: if you signal
 * a PID, while another thread is in waitpid(), the signal may fire either
 * before or after the process is reaped.  This means that your signal can,
 * in pathological circumstances, be delivered to the wrong process (ouch!).
 * To avoid this, you should only use non-blocking waits (i.e. poll()), and
 * make sure to serialize your signals (i.e. kill()) with the waits --
 * either wait & signal from the same thread, or use a mutex.

   * 1) You MUST consume all data passed to readCallback (or return true to
   * close the pipe).  Similarly, you MUST write to a writable pipe (or
   * return true to close the pipe).  To do otherwise is an error that can
   * result in a deadlock.  You must do this even for pipes you are not
   * interested in.
   *
   * 2) pfd is nonblocking, so be prepared for read() / write() to return -1
   * and set errno to EAGAIN (in which case you should return false).  Use
   * readNoInt() from FileUtil.h to handle interrupted reads for you.
   *
   * 3) Your callbacks MUST NOT call any of the Subprocess methods that
   * manipulate the pipe FDs.  Check the docblocks, but, for example,
   * neither closeParentFd (return true instead) nor takeOwnershipOfPipes
   * are safe.  Stick to reading/writing from pfd, as appropriate.
   *
   * == Good to know ==
   *
   * 1) See ReadLinesCallback for an easy way to consume the child's output
   * streams line-by-line (or tokenized by another delimiter).
   *
   * 2) "Wait until the descendants close the pipes" is usually the behavior
   * you want, since the descendants may have something to say even if the
   * immediate child is dead.  If you need to be able to force-close all
   * parent FDs, communicate() will NOT work for you.  Do it your own way by
   * using takeOwnershipOfPipes().
   *
   * Why not? You can return "true" from your callbacks to sever active
   * pipes, but inactive ones can remain open indefinitely.  It is
   * impossible to safely close inactive pipes while another thread is
   * blocked in communicate().  This is BY DESIGN.  Racing communicate()'s
   * read/write callbacks can result in wrong I/O and data corruption.  This
   * class would need internal synchronization and timeouts, a poor and
   * expensive implementation choice, in order to make closeParentFd()
   * thread-safe.

  /**
   * A readCallback for Subprocess::communicate() that helps you consume
   * lines (or other delimited pieces) from your subprocess's file
   * descriptors.  Use the readLinesCallback() helper to get template
   * deduction.  For example:
   *
   *   subprocess.communicate(
   *     Subprocess::readLinesCallback(
   *       [](int fd, folly::StringPiece s) {
   *         std::cout << fd << " said: " << s;

   *   );
   *
   * If a file line exceeds maxLineLength, your callback will get some
   * initial chunks of maxLineLength with no trailing delimiters.  The final
   * chunk of a line is delimiter-terminated iff the delimiter was present
   * in the input.  In particular, the last line in a file always lacks a
   * delimiter -- so if a file ends on a delimiter, the final line is empty.
   *
   * Like a regular communicate() callback, your fdLineCb() normally returns
   * false.  It may return true to tell Subprocess to close the underlying
   * file descriptor.  The child process may then receive SIGPIPE or get
   * EPIPE errors on writes.
