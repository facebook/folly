/**
 * Subprocess library, modeled after Python's subprocess module
 * (http://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html)
 *
 * This library defines one class (Subprocess) which represents a child
 * process.  Subprocess has two constructors: one that takes a vector<string>
 * and executes the given executable without using the shell, and one
 * that takes a string and executes the given command using the shell.
 * Subprocess allows you to redirect the child's standard input, standard
 * output, and standard error to/from child descriptors in the parent,
 * or to create communication pipes between the child and the parent.
 *
 * The simplest example is a thread-safe version of the system() library
 * function:
 *    Subprocess(cmd).wait();
 * which executes the command using the default shell and waits for it
 * to complete, returning the exit status.
 *
 * A thread-safe version of popen() (type="r", to read from the child):
 *    Subprocess proc(cmd, Subprocess::pipeStdout());
 *    // read from proc.stdout()
 *    proc.wait();
 *
 * A thread-safe version of popen() (type="w", to write to the child):
 *    Subprocess proc(cmd, Subprocess::pipeStdin());
 *    // write to proc.stdin()
 *    proc.wait();
 *
 * If you want to redirect both stdin and stdout to pipes, you can, but
 * note that you're subject to a variety of deadlocks.  You'll want to use
 * nonblocking I/O; look at the implementation of communicate() for an example.
 *
 * communicate() is a way to communicate to a child via its standard input,
 * standard output, and standard error.  It buffers everything in memory,
 * so it's not great for large amounts of data (or long-running processes),
 * but it insulates you from the deadlocks mentioned above.
