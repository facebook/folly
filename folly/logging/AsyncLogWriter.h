/**
 * An abstract LogWriter implementation that provides functionality for
 * asynchronous IO operations. Users can subclass this class and provide their
 * own IO operation implementation by overriding `performIO` method. This class
 * will automatically manage incoming log messages and call the method in
 * appropriate time.
 *
 * This class performs the log I/O in a separarate thread.
 *
 * The advantage of this class over ImmediateFileWriter is that logging I/O can
 * never slow down or block your normal program operation.  If log messages are
 * generated faster than they can be written, messages will be dropped (and an
 * indication of how many messages were dropped will be written to the log file
 * when we are able to catch up a bit.)
 *
 * However, one downside is that if your program crashes, not all log messages
 * may have been written, so you may lose messages generated immediately before
 * the crash.
