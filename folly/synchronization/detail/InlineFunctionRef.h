/**
 * InlineFunctionRef is similar to folly::FunctionRef but has the additional
 * benefit of being able to store the function it was instantiated with inline
 * in a buffer of the given capacity.  Inline storage is only used if the
 * function object and a pointer (for type-erasure) are small enough to fit in
 * the templated size.  If there is not enough in-situ capacity for the
 * callable, this just stores a reference to the function object like
 * FunctionRef.
 *
 * This helps give a perf boost in the case where the data gets separated from
 * the point of invocation.  If, for example, at the point of invocation, the
 * InlineFunctionRef object is not cached, a remote memory/cache read might be
 * required to invoke the original callable.  Customizable inline storage
 * helps tune storage so we can store a type-erased callable with better
 * performance and locality.  A real-life example of this might be a
 * folly::FunctionRef with a function pointer.  The folly::FunctionRef would
 * point to the function pointer object in a remote location.  This causes a
 * double-indirection at the point of invocation, and if that memory is dirty,
 * or not cached, it would cause additional cache misses.  On the other hand
 * with InlineFunctionRef, inline storage would store the value of the
 * function pointer, avoiding the need to do a remote lookup to fetch the
 * value of the function pointer.
 *
 * To prevent misuse, InlineFunctionRef disallows construction from an lvalue
 * callable.  This is to prevent usage where a user relies on the callable's
 * state after invocation through InlineFunctionRef.  This has the potential
 * to copy the callable into inline storage when the callable is small, so we
 * might not use the same function when invoking, but rather a copy of it.
 *
 * Also note that InlineFunctionRef will always invoke the const qualified
 * version of the call operator for any callable that is passed.  Regardless
 * of whether it has a non-const version.  This is done to enforce the logical
 * constraint of function state being immutable.
 *
 * This class is always trivially-copyable (and therefore
 * trivially-destructible), making it suitable for use in a union without
 * requiring manual destruction.
