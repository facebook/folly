    // sizes, NUMA interactions and processor models

    // The current version of the Intel optimization manual confirms this
    // theory somewhat as well in section 2.3.5.1 (Load and Store Operation

    //    When an instruction writes data to a memory location [...], the

    //    data happens after instruction retirement.  Therefore, the store
    //    latency usually does not affect the store instruction itself
    //
    // This gives the user the ability to input up to 48 bytes into the
    // combined critical section through an InlineFunctionRef and output 48
    // bytes from it basically without any cost.  The type of the entity

    // waiters.  Because the mutex is packed in 8 bytes, and we need an

    // up all waiters when a clean unlock is committed, when a thread saw a
    // timed waiter in the mutex previously.

    // putting a 0b11 here works for a set of reasons that is a superset of

    // mutex state.  Now that the thread has put (kTimedWaiter | kLocked)

    // scenarios possible.  The first being when there is no contention chain
    // formation in the mutex from the time a timed waiter got a lock to
    // unlock.  In this case, the unlocker sees a 0b11 in the mutex state,
    // adjusts to the presence of a timed waiter and cleanly unlocks with a
    // kUnlocked (0b0).  The second is when there is a contention chain.
    // When a thread puts its address in the mutex and sees the timed bit, it
    // records the presence of a timed waiter, and then pretends as if it
    // hadn't seen the timed bit.  So future contention chain releases, will
    // terminate with a kLocked (0b1) and not a (kLocked | kTimedWaiter)
    // (0b11).  This just works naturally with the rest of the algorithm
    // without incurring a perf hit for the regular non-timed case

    // to waiting threads.  We don't do anything to try and minimize this

    // we need to use a fetch_or() here because we need to convey two bits of
