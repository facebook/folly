/*
 * This header defines a few very small mutex types.  These are useful
 * in highly memory-constrained environments where contention is
 * unlikely.
 *
 * Note: these locks are for use when you aren't likely to contend on
 * the critical section, or when the critical section is incredibly
 * small.  Given that, both of the locks defined in this header are
 * inherently unfair: that is, the longer a thread is waiting, the
 * longer it waits between attempts to acquire, so newer waiters are
 * more likely to get the mutex.  For the intended use-case this is
 * fine.
