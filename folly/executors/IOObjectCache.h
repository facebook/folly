 * IOObjectCache manages objects of type T that are dependent on an EventBase
 * provided by the global IOExecutor.
 *
 * Provide a factory that creates T objects given an EventBase, and get() will
 * lazily create T objects based on an EventBase from the global IOExecutor.
 * These are stored thread locally - for a given pair of event base and calling
 * thread there will only be one T object created.
 *
 * The primary use case is for managing objects that need to do async IO on an
 * event base (e.g. thrift clients) that can be used outside the IO thread
 * without much hassle. For instance, you could use this to manage Thrift
 * clients that are only ever called from within other threads without the
 * calling thread needing to know anything about the IO threads that the clients
 * will do their work on.
