//  pairable with its acquire: a move re-keys the existing record instead of
//  looking like a release plus an unrelated acquire, so the recorded set is
//  the exact set of live keep-alives rather than a biased sample of them.
//
//  Only keep-alives which hold an executor reference count are acquired and
//  released: dummy and alias keep-alives hold none, and are skipped on exactly
//  the same condition ExecutorKeepAlive::reset() uses to decide whether to call
//  keepAliveRelease(). The move hook is deliberately not filtered that way: it
//  fires for every move, so `from` may be an address no acquire ever reported.
//  A hook must read that as "`to` holds no counted reference either" and drop
//  any record it holds for `to` -- which is also what clears a record stranded
//  at a recycled address.
//

//  points compile away and the keep-alive path is unchanged. With it, and with
//  no hooks installed, each trace point is a relaxed load of a never-written
//  global and a FOLLY_UNLIKELY branch. With hooks installed it costs whatever
//  the hook costs on every acquire, release and move process-wide -- install
//  only for a diagnostic run. The hooks run from arbitrary threads: they must
