/*
 * TimeseriesHistogram tracks data distributions as they change over time.
 *
 * Specifically, it is a bucketed histogram with different value ranges assigned
 * to each bucket.  Within each bucket is a MultiLevelTimeSeries from
 * 'folly/stats/MultiLevelTimeSeries.h'. This means that each bucket contains a
 * different set of data for different historical time periods, and one can
 * query data distributions over different trailing time windows.
 *
 * For example, this can answer questions: "What is the data distribution over
 * the last minute? Over the last 10 minutes?  Since I last cleared this
 * histogram?"
 *
 * The class can also estimate percentiles and answer questions like: "What was
 * the 99th percentile data value over the last 10 minutes?"
 *
 * Note: that depending on the size of your buckets and the smoothness
 * of your data distribution, the estimate may be way off from the actual
 * value.  In particular, if the given percentile falls outside of the bucket
 * range (i.e. your buckets range in 0 - 100,000 but the 99th percentile is
 * around 115,000) this estimate may be very wrong.
 *
 * The memory usage for a typical histogram is roughly 3k * (# of buckets).  All
 * insertion operations are amortized O(1), and all queries are O(# of buckets).
