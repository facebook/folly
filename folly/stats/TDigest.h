/*
 * TDigests are a biased quantile estimator designed to estimate the values of
 * the quantiles of streaming data with high accuracy and low memory,
 * particularly for quantiles at the tails (p0.1, p1, p99, p99.9). See
 * https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf
 * for an explanation of what the purpose of TDigests is, and how they work.
 *
 * There is a notable difference between the implementation here and the
 * implementation in the paper. In the paper, the recommended scaling function
 * for bucketing centroids is an arcsin function. The arcsin function provides
 * high accuracy for low memory, but comes at a relatively high compute cost.
 * A good choice algorithm has the following properties:
 *   - The value of the function k(0, delta) = 0, and k(1, delta) = delta.
 *     This is a requirement for any t-digest function.
 *   - The limit of the derivative of the function dk/dq at 0 is inf, and at
 *     1 is inf. This provides bias to improve accuracy at the tails.
 *   - For any q <= 0.5, dk/dq(q) = dk/dq(1-q). This ensures that the accuracy
 *     of upper and lower quantiles are equivalent.
 * As such, TDigest uses a sqrt function with these properties, which is faster
 * than arcsin. There is a small, but relatively negligible impact to accuracy
 * at the tail. In empirical tests, accuracy of the sqrt approach has been
 * adequate.
