/// MPMCQueue<T> is a high-performance bounded concurrent queue that
/// supports multiple producers, multiple consumers, and optional blocking.
/// The queue has a fixed capacity, for which all memory will be allocated
/// up front.  The bulk of the work of enqueuing and dequeuing can be
/// performed in parallel.
///
/// MPMCQueue is linearizable.  That means that if a call to write(A)
/// returns before a call to write(B) begins, then A will definitely end up
/// in the queue before B, and if a call to read(X) returns before a call
/// to read(Y) is started, that X will be something from earlier in the
/// queue than Y.  This also means that if a read call returns a value, you
/// can be sure that all previous elements of the queue have been assigned
/// a reader (that reader might not yet have returned, but it exists).
///
/// The underlying implementation uses a ticket dispenser for the head and
/// the tail, spreading accesses across N single-element queues to produce
/// a queue with capacity N.  The ticket dispensers use atomic increment,
/// which is more robust to contention than a CAS loop.  Each of the
/// single-element queues uses its own CAS to serialize access, with an
/// adaptive spin cutoff.  When spinning fails on a single-element queue
/// it uses futex()'s _BITSET operations to reduce unnecessary wakeups
/// even if multiple waiters are present on an individual queue (such as
/// when the MPMCQueue's capacity is smaller than the number of enqueuers
/// or dequeuers).
///
/// In benchmarks (contained in tao/queues/ConcurrentQueueTests)
/// it handles 1 to 1, 1 to N, N to 1, and N to M thread counts better
/// than any of the alternatives present in fbcode, for both small (~10)
/// and large capacities.  In these benchmarks it is also faster than
/// tbb::concurrent_bounded_queue for all configurations.  When there are
/// many more threads than cores, MPMCQueue is _much_ faster than the tbb
/// queue because it uses futex() to block and unblock waiting threads,
/// rather than spinning with sched_yield.
///
/// NOEXCEPT INTERACTION: tl;dr; If it compiles you're fine.  Ticket-based
/// queues separate the assignment of queue positions from the actual
/// construction of the in-queue elements, which means that the T
/// constructor used during enqueue must not throw an exception.  This is
/// enforced at compile time using type traits, which requires that T be
/// adorned with accurate noexcept information.  If your type does not
/// use noexcept, you will have to wrap it in something that provides
/// the guarantee.  We provide an alternate safe implementation for types
/// that don't use noexcept but that are marked folly::IsRelocatable
/// and boost::has_nothrow_constructor, which is common for folly types.
/// In particular, if you can declare FOLLY_ASSUME_FBVECTOR_COMPATIBLE
/// then your type can be put in MPMCQueue.
///
/// If you have a pool of N queue consumers that you want to shut down
/// after the queue has drained, one way is to enqueue N sentinel values
/// to the queue.  If the producer doesn't know how many consumers there
/// are you can enqueue one sentinel and then have each consumer requeue
/// two sentinels after it receives it (by requeuing 2 the shutdown can
/// complete in O(log P) time instead of O(P)).

/// Compare this strategy to sem_t's separate num_waiters field, which
/// isn't decremented until after the waiting thread gets scheduled,
/// during which time more enqueues might have occurred and made pointless
/// FUTEX_WAKE calls.
///
/// TurnSequencer uses futex() directly.  It is optimized for the
/// case that the highest awaited turn is 32 or less higher than the
/// current turn.  We use the FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET variant, which lets
/// us embed 32 separate wakeup channels in a single futex.  See
/// http://locklessinc.com/articles/futex_cheat_sheet for a description.
///
/// We only need to keep exact track of the delta between the current

/// point they can then adjust the delta using the higher base.  Since we
/// need to encode waiter deltas of 0 to 32 inclusive, we use 6 bits.
/// We actually store waiter deltas up to 63, since that might reduce
/// the number of CAS operations a tiny bit.
///
/// To avoid some futex() calls entirely, TurnSequencer uses an adaptive
