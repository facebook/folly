/*
 * An 8-byte pointer with an integrated spin lock and 15-bit integer
 * (you can use this for a size of the allocation, if you want, or
 * something else, or nothing).
 *
 * This is using an x64-specific detail about the effective virtual
 * address space.  Long story short: the upper two bytes of all our
 * pointers will be zero in reality---and if you have a couple billion
 * such pointers in core, it makes pretty good sense to try to make
 * use of that memory.  The exact details can be perused here:
 *
 *    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Canonical_form_addresses
 *
 * This is not a "smart" pointer: nothing automagical is going on
 * here.  Locking is up to the user.  Resource deallocation is up to
 * the user.  Locks are never acquired or released outside explicit
 * calls to lock() and unlock().
 *
 * Change the value of the raw pointer with set(), but you must hold
 * the lock when calling this function if multiple threads could be
 * using this class.
 *
 * TODO(jdelong): should we use the low order bit for the lock, so we
 * get a whole 16-bits for our integer?  (There's also 2 more bits
 * down there if the pointer comes from malloc.)
