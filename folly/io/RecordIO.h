/**
 * RecordIO: self-synchronizing stream of variable length records
 *
 * RecordIO gives you the ability to write a stream of variable length records
 * and read them later even in the face of data corruption -- randomly inserted
 * or deleted chunks of the file, or modified data.  When reading, you may lose
 * corrupted records, but the stream will resynchronize automatically.
