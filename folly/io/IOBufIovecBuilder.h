 * IOBufIovecBuilder exists to help allocate and fill IOBuf chains using

 *
 * It provides APIs to allocate buffers for use with iovec-based system calls,
 * and then construct IOBuf chains pointing to the buffer data that has been
 * populated.
 *
 * This class allows performing repeated vectored reads and minimizing the
 * number of separate allocations if data is received in small chunks, while
 * still generating unshared IOBuf instances.  For instance, this helps support
 * in place decryption mechanisms which require unshared IOBuf instances.
