 *  ScopedBoundPort
 *
 *  Binds to an ephemeral port in the ctor but does not listen. Unbinds from the
 *  port in the dtor.
 *
 *  While an instance is in scope, we know at least one port which is guaranteed
 *  not to be listening - the port the instance binds but does not listen.
 *
 *  Useful for testing server-down cases.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *    TEST(MyClient, WhenTheServerIsDown_ThrowsServerDownException) {
 *      folly::ScopedBoundPort bound;
 *      MyClient client(bound.getAddress(), 100ms);
 *      EXPECT_THROW(client.getData(), ServerDownException);
 *    }
