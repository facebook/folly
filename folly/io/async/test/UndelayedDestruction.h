/**
 * A helper class to allow a DelayedDestruction object to be instantiated on
 * the stack.
 *
 * This class derives from an existing DelayedDestruction type and makes the
 * destructor public again.  This allows objects of this type to be declared on
 * the stack or directly inside another class.  Normally DelayedDestruction
 * objects must be dynamically allocated on the heap.
 *
 * However, the trade-off is that you lose some of the protections provided by
 * DelayedDestruction::destroy().  DelayedDestruction::destroy() will
 * automatically delay destruction of the object until it is safe to do so.
 * If you use UndelayedDestruction, you become responsible for ensuring that
 * you only destroy the object where it is safe to do so.  Attempting to
 * destroy a UndelayedDestruction object while it has a non-zero destructor
 * guard count will abort the program.
