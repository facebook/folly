/**
 * Check how long a timeout took to fire.
 *
 * This method verifies:
 * - that the timeout did not fire too early (never less than expectedMS)
 * - that the timeout fired within a reasonable period of the expected
 *   duration.  It must fire within the specified tolerance, excluding time
 *   that this process spent waiting to be scheduled.
 *
 * @param start                 A TimePoint object set just before the timeout
 *                              was scheduled.
 * @param end                   A TimePoint object set when the timeout fired.
 * @param expectedMS            The timeout duration, in milliseconds
 * @param tolerance             The tolerance, in milliseconds.
