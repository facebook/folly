/**
 * AsyncTransport defines an asynchronous API for bidirectional streaming I/O.
 *
 * This class provides an API to for asynchronously waiting for data

 *
 * The APIs for reading and writing are intentionally asymmetric.  Waiting for
 * data to read is a persistent API: a callback is installed, and is notified
 * whenever new data is available.  It continues to be notified of new events
 * until it is uninstalled.
 *
 * AsyncTransport does not provide read timeout functionality, because it
 * typically cannot determine when the timeout should be active.  Generally, a
 * timeout should only be enabled when processing is blocked waiting on data
 * from the remote endpoint.  For server-side applications, the timeout should
 * not be active if the server is currently processing one or more outstanding
 * requests on this transport.  For client-side applications, the timeout
 * should not be active if there are no requests pending on the transport.
 * Additionally, if a client has multiple pending requests, it will ususally
 * want a separate timeout for each request, rather than a single read timeout.
 *
 * The write API is fairly intuitive: a user can request to send a block of
 * data, and a callback will be informed once the entire block has been
 * transferred to the kernel, or on error.  AsyncTransport does provide a send
 * timeout, since most callers want to give up if the remote end stops
 * responding and no further progress can be made sending the data.
