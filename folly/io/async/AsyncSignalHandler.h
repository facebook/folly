 * A handler to receive notification about POSIX signals.
 *
 * AsyncSignalHandler allows code to process signals from within a EventBase
 * loop.
 *
 * Standard signal handlers interrupt execution of the main thread, and
 * are run while the main thread is paused.  As a result, great care must be
 * taken to avoid race conditions if the signal handler has to access or modify
 * any data used by the main thread.
 *
 * AsyncSignalHandler solves this problem by running the AsyncSignalHandler
 * callback in normal thread of execution, as a EventBase callback.
 *
 * AsyncSignalHandler may only be used in a single thread.  It will only
 * process signals received by the thread where the AsyncSignalHandler is
 * registered.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that signals are
 * delivered to the desired thread in multi-threaded programs.
