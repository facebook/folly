 * This class is a wrapper for all asynchronous I/O processing functionality

 * when a specified timeout has expired.  More complex, higher-level callback
 * mechanisms can then be built on top of EventHandler and AsyncTimeout.
 *
 * A EventBase object can only drive an event loop for a single thread.  To
 * take advantage of multiple CPU cores, most asynchronous I/O servers have one
 * thread per CPU, and use a separate EventBase for each thread.
 *
 * In general, most EventBase methods may only be called from the thread
 * running the EventBase's loop.  There are a few exceptions to this rule, for
 * methods that are explicitly intended to allow communication with a
 * EventBase from other threads.  When it is safe to call a method from
 * another thread it is explicitly listed in the method comments.
