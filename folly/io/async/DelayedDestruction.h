 * DelayedDestruction is a helper class to ensure objects are not deleted

 *
 * This is useful for objects that invoke callback functions, to ensure that a
 * callback does not destroy the calling object.
 *
 * Classes needing this functionality should:
 * - derive from DelayedDestruction
 * - make their destructor private or protected, so it cannot be called
 *   directly
 * - create a DestructorGuard object on the stack in each public method that
 *   may invoke a callback
 *
 * DelayedDestruction does not perform any locking.  It is intended to be used
 * only from a single thread.
