//  unsafe_for_async_usage
//
//  Defines member type alias folly_is_unsafe_for_async_usage, which is the tag
//  marking the class as unsafe for async usage. Serves as a convenience wrapper
//  around the tag.
//
//  The meaning of the tag is that the current thread must not be yielded in any
//  way during the lifetime of any tagged object.
//
//  The most common form of yielding the current thread during the lifetime of
//  an object is where the lifetime of the object crosses a coroutine suspension
//  point. Example:
//
//    struct unsafe : private unsafe_for_async_usage {};
//    Task<> sink();
//    Task<> go() {
//      unsafe object; // object is tagged as unsafe for async usage
//      co_await sink(); // but crossing the co_await is async usage
//    }
//
//  Some objects, especially some which are intended for use with the RAII
//  pattern, may be thread-sensitive and permit access only on one single thread
//  throughout their lifetimes. Or they may be non-reentrant and may permit only
//  well-nested accesses or may not permit any reentrant accesses at all. In
//  either case, they do not permit yielding the current thread during their
//  lifetimes. Examples:
//  * Some objects that rely internally on thread-locals.
//    * In particular, the storage defined by FOLLY_DECLARE_REUSED.
//  * Some advanced concurrency primitives.
//    * In particular, hazard-pointers and rcu-guards.
//
//  Note that the current thread being yielded refers to any form of cooperative
//  multitasking, such as coroutines, as compared with the kernel preempting the
//  current thread and then resuming it later.
//
//  In order to mark a class type, either:
//  * Declare a member type alias folly_is_unsafe_for_async_usage, following the
//    pattern of member type alias is_transparent.
//  * Declare either a non-static data member or a base which is marked. As a
//    convenience, unsafe_for_async_usage is marked and may be used as that non-
//    static data member or base. If using a non-static data member, it is ideal
//    to declare it with attribute [[no_unique_address]], possibly as wrapped in
//    FOLLY_ATTR_NO_UNIQUE_ADDRESS, to avoid increasing the size of the class.
//
//  It is recommended to use a non-static data member or a base which is marked,
//  in preference to using a member type alias, since it is impossible to typo
//  the spelling of a non-static data member or base while it is easy to typo
//  the spelling of a member type alias.
//
//  Example:
//
//    struct thread_counter {
//      static thread_local int value;
//    };
//    struct thread_counter_raii : private unsafe_for_async_usage {
//      thread_counter_raii() { ++thread_counter::value; }
//      ~thread_counter_raii() { --thread_counter::value; }
//    };
//    coroutine callee();
//    coroutine caller() {
//      thread_counter_raii g;
//      co_await callee(); // static analysis might warn here
//    }
//
//  This marker can be used to implement a static analysis that detects misuses
//  with objects of classes marked with this tag, namely, where the current
//  thread may be yielded in any way during the lifetimes of such objects.
struct unsafe_for_async_usage { // a convenience wrapper for the marker below:
  using folly_is_unsafe_for_async_usage = void; // the marker member type alias
};
