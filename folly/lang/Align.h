// max_align_v is the alignment of max_align_t.
//
// max_align_t is a type which is aligned at least as strictly as the
// most-aligned basic type (see the specification of std::max_align_t). This
// implementation exists because 32-bit iOS platforms have a broken
// std::max_align_t (see below).
//
// You should refer to this as `::folly::max_align_t` in portable code, even if
// you have `using namespace folly;` because C11 defines a global namespace
// `max_align_t` type.
//
// To be certain, we consider every non-void fundamental type specified by the
// standard. On most platforms `long double` would be enough, but iOS 32-bit
// has an 8-byte aligned `double` and `long long int` and a 4-byte aligned
// `long double`.
//
// So far we've covered locals and other non-allocated storage, but we also need
// confidence that allocated storage from `malloc`, `new`, etc will also be
// suitable for objects with this alignment requirement.
//
// Apple document that their implementation of malloc will issue 16-byte
// granularity chunks for small allocations (large allocations are page-size
// granularity and page-aligned). We think that allocated storage will be
// suitable for these objects based on the following assumptions:
//
// 1. 16-byte granularity also means 16-byte aligned.
// 2. `new` and other allocators follow the `malloc` rules.
//
// We also have some anecdotal evidence: we don't see lots of misaligned-storage
// crashes on 32-bit iOS apps that use `double`.
