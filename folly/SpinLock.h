/*
 * N.B. You most likely do _not_ want to use SpinLock or any other
 * kind of spinlock.  Use std::mutex instead.
 *
 * In short, spinlocks in preemptive multi-tasking operating systems
 * have serious problems and fast mutexes like std::mutex are almost
 * certainly the better choice, because letting the OS scheduler put a
 * thread to sleep is better for system responsiveness and throughput
 * than wasting a timeslice repeatedly querying a lock held by a
 * thread that's blocked, and you can't prevent userspace
 * programs blocking.
 *
 * Spinlocks in an operating system kernel make much more sense than
 * they do in userspace.
