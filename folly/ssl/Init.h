/**
 * Set preferences for how to treat locks in OpenSSL.  This must be

 *
 * OpenSSL has a lock for each module rather than for each object or
 * data that needs locking.  Some locks protect only refcounts, and
 * might be better as spinlocks rather than mutexes.  Other locks
 * may be totally unnecessary if the objects being protected are not
 * shared between threads in the application.
 *
 * For a list of OpenSSL lock types, refer to crypto/crypto.h.
 *
 * By default, all locks are initialized as mutexes.  OpenSSL's lock usage
 * may change from version to version and you should know what you are doing
 * before disabling any locks entirely.
 *
 * In newer versions of OpenSSL (>= 1.1.0), OpenSSL manages its own locks,
 * and this function is a no-op.
 *
 * Example: if you don't share SSL sessions between threads in your
 * application, you may be able to do this
 *
 * setSSLLockTypes({{
 *  CRYPTO_LOCK_SSL_SESSION,
 *  SSLContext::SSLLockType::LOCK_NONE
 * }})
