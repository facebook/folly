// The Nth call to wait() completes the previous N-1 futures successfully,
// returns a future that is already completed successfully, and resets the
// barrier; the barrier may be reused immediately, as soon as at least one
// of the future completions has been observed.

// Of these N futures, exactly one is completed with true, while the others are
// completed with false; it is unspecified which future completes with true.
// (This may be used to elect a "leader" among a group of threads.)
//
// If the barrier is destroyed, any futures already returned by wait() will
// complete with an error.
