 * A DrivableExecutor can be driven via its drive() method
 * Examples include EventBase (via loopOnce()) and ManualExecutor
 * (via makeProgress()).
 *
 * This interface is most handy in conjunction with
 * Future<T>::getVia(DrivableExecutor*) and
 * Future<T>::waitVia(DrivableExecutor*)
 *
 * These call drive() * repeatedly until the Future is fulfilled.
 * getVia() returns the value (or throws the exception) and waitVia() returns
 * the same Future for chainability.
 *
 * These will be most helpful in tests, for instance if you need to pump a mock
 * EventBase until Futures complete.
