// This file contains several classes that might be useful if you are
// trying to dynamically optimize cache locality: CacheLocality reads
// cache sharing information from sysfs to determine how CPUs should be
// grouped to minimize contention, Getcpu provides fast access to the
// current CPU via __vdso_getcpu, and AccessSpreader uses these two to
// optimally spread accesses among a predetermined number of stripes.
//
// AccessSpreader<>::current(n) microbenchmarks at 22 nanos, which is
// substantially less than the cost of a cache miss.  This means that we
// can effectively use it to reduce cache line ping-pong on striped data
// structures such as IndexedMemPool or statistics counters.
//
// Because CacheLocality looks at all of the cache levels, it can be
// used for different levels of optimization.  AccessSpreader(2) does
// per-chip spreading on a dual socket system.  AccessSpreader(numCpus)
// does perfect per-cpu spreading.  AccessSpreader(numCpus / 2) does
// perfect L1 spreading in a system with hyperthreading enabled.
