/// A TurnSequencer allows threads to order their execution according to
/// a monotonically increasing (with wraparound) "turn" value.  The two
/// operations provided are to wait for turn T, and to move to the next
/// turn.  Every thread that is waiting for T must have arrived before
/// that turn is marked completed (for MPMCQueue only one thread waits
/// for any particular turn, so this is trivially true).
///
/// TurnSequencer's state_ holds 26 bits of the current turn (shifted
/// left by 6), along with a 6 bit saturating value that records the
/// maximum waiter minus the current turn.  Wraparound of the turn space
/// is expected and handled.  This allows us to atomically adjust the
/// number of outstanding waiters when we perform a FUTEX_WAKE operation.
/// Compare this strategy to sem_t's separate num_waiters field, which
/// isn't decremented until after the waiting thread gets scheduled,
/// during which time more enqueues might have occurred and made pointless
/// FUTEX_WAKE calls.
///
/// TurnSequencer uses futex() directly.  It is optimized for the
/// case that the highest awaited turn is 32 or less higher than the
/// current turn.  We use the FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET variant, which lets
/// us embed 32 separate wakeup channels in a single futex.  See
/// http://locklessinc.com/articles/futex_cheat_sheet for a description.
///
/// We only need to keep exact track of the delta between the current
/// turn and the maximum waiter for the 32 turns that follow the current
/// one, because waiters at turn t+32 will be awoken at turn t.  At that
/// point they can then adjust the delta using the higher base.  Since we
/// need to encode waiter deltas of 0 to 32 inclusive, we use 6 bits.
/// We actually store waiter deltas up to 63, since that might reduce
/// the number of CAS operations a tiny bit.
///
/// To avoid some futex() calls entirely, TurnSequencer uses an adaptive
/// spin cutoff before waiting.  The overheads (and convergence rate)
/// of separately tracking the spin cutoff for each TurnSequencer would
/// be prohibitive, so the actual storage is passed in as a parameter and
/// updated atomically.  This also lets the caller use different adaptive
/// cutoffs for different operations (read versus write, for example).
/// To avoid contention, the spin cutoff is only updated when requested
/// by the caller.
