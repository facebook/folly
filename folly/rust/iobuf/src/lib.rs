//! Rust binding for `folly::IOBuf`
//!
//! This primarily intended for interop with C++ APIs which use `folly::IOBuf` as part of their
//! interface, rather than as a full-featured Rust API.
//!
//! The basic types are:
//!
//! `IOBufShared` - this Rust type owns a specific `folly::IOBuf` node in a circular chain,
//!    which is considered to be the head of the chain. The individual buffers can point to
//!    distinct or common underlying memory, which may also be shared with other IOBuf chains.
//!    This type only presents a read-only API. Data is read via `IOBufCursor` (implementing
//!    `bytes::Buf`) or `IOBufIter` (implementing an iterator over byte slices).
//!
//! `IOBufMut` - Structurally identical to `IOBufShared`, but has the further guarantee that
//!    the underlying memory is not shared, and can therefore be safely modified. Data can be
//!    extended via `IOBufMutCursor`'s `bytes::BufMut` implementation, or data can be modified
//!    in place via `IOBufMutIter`'s iterator over `&mut [u8]`.
//!
//! Normally IOBuf instances will either be allocated by C++ code, but it also supports wrapping
//! `Vec<u8>` in an `IOBuf` to allow zero-copy operations from Rust `Vec<u8>` or `Bytes` instances.

#![deny(warnings)]
#![allow(clippy::upper_case_acronyms)] // We use the same IOBuf capitalization as C++.
