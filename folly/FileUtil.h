 * anyway), and only exists because POSIX allows read() to return an incomplete
 * read if interrupted by a signal (instead of returning -1 and setting errno
 * to EINTR).
 *
 * Note that this wrapper weakens the thread safety of read(): the file pointer
 * is shared between threads, but the system call is atomic.  If multiple
 * threads are reading from a file at the same time, you don't know where your
 * data came from in the file, but you do know that the returned bytes were
 * contiguous.  You can no longer make this assumption if using readFull().
 * You should probably use pread() when reading from the same file descriptor
 * from multiple threads simultaneously, anyway.

 * readv and preadv.  The contents of iov after these functions return
 * is unspecified.
