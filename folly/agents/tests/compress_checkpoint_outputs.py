"""Compress a saved run without losing files from any draft.

Before compression, a sample keeps its final draft in output/ and earlier drafts
in output-PHASE/.

Saved stages contain the author's files, not reviewer reports:

- initial: the first draft, before author self-review;
- author: after author self-review, before external review;
- reviewN: after incorporating external review N and checking the revisions.

Usage: python3 -m folly.agents.tests.compress_checkpoint_outputs SAMPLE

Keep final output/ readable and share identical file contents across phases.
For the same filename in adjacent phases, use a forward normal diff when it is
smaller than 60% of the later file. Append .diff to the complete relative filename.
Store patches and whole replacement files together in output-A-to-B/.

Example: two external review rounds. Author review makes a small edit to main.md
but rewrites docs/guide.md, so main.md uses a patch and guide.md stays whole.
It also adds notes.md and deletes retired.md. Review1 makes small edits to both
documents. The final review2 draft lives only in output/.
Empty directories are omitted from these trees.

        notes.md                          checkpoints.json
      checkpoints.json

checkpoints.json lists each phase's complete file set. Restore author's main.md
from its initial file plus output-initial-to-author/main.md.diff. Copy guide.md
whole from output-initial-to-author/docs/guide.md, and notes.md from output/.
Review1 adds another patch to main.md's chain, but patches guide.md's author
version. Each file has its own base and ordered patches.

Restoration creates a new tree from that file map, not an overlay on the previous
phase; retired.md therefore stays absent from author and later drafts. Identical
contents can share a base even when their filenames differ.

Verify every restored path and byte before removing redundant copies.
If a patch name matches a real file or directory, keep the changed file whole.
Files without a final newline stay whole: the normal-diff reader cannot apply
their missing-newline markers. Restore with SAMPLE --restore PHASE --destination PATH; the destination
must not exist.
