 * than the result of getCurrentThreadID().
 *
 * There are some potential caveats about this API, however:
 *
 * - In theory there is no guarantee that application threads map one-to-one to
 *   kernel threads.  An application threading implementation could potentially
 *   share one OS thread across multiple application threads, and/or it could
 *   potentially move application threads between different OS threads over
 *   time.  However, in practice all of the platforms we currently support have
 *   a one-to-one mapping between userspace threads and operating system
 *   threads.
 *
 * - This API may also be slightly slower than getCurrentThreadID() on some
 *   platforms.  This API may require a system call, where getCurrentThreadID()
 *   may only need to read thread-local memory.
 *
 * On Linux the returned value is a pid_t, and can be used in contexts
 * requiring a thread pid_t.
 *
 * The thread ID may be reused once the thread it corresponds to has been
 * joined.
