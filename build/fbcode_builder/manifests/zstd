# The zstd cmake build explicitly sets the install name
# for the shared library in such a way that cmake discards
# the path to the library from the install_name, rendering
# the library non-resolvable during the build.  The short
# term solution for this is just to link static on macos.
#
# And while we're at it, let's just always link statically.
