# no openssl or zlib in the linux case, why?
# these are usually installed on the system
# and are the easiest system deps to pull in.
# In the future we want to be able to express
# that a system dep is sufficient in the manifest
# for eg: openssl and zlib, but for now we don't
# have it.

# macOS doesn't expose the openssl api so we need
# to build our own.
