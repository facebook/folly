# fboss (which added the libcurl dep) doesn't need ldap so it is disabled here.
# if someone in the future wants to add ldap for something else, it won't hurt
# fboss. However, that would require adding an ldap manifest.
#
# For the same reason, we disable libssh2 and libidn2 which aren't really used
# but would require adding manifests if we don't disable them.
